# Project Overview
The project is a mobile application and website designed specifically for farmers, enabling
them to buy and sell crops, seeds, and agricultural equipment in a seamless and user-
friendly manner, while providing regularly updated market prices for both sellers and buyers.
The platform is not only a marketplace but also integrates AI-powered smart features that
help farmers assess land health, detect potential soil problems, and receive suitable
solutions. In critical cases, the application guides farmers to consult the nearest agricultural
engineer.
The core idea of the project is to bridge modern technology with traditional agriculture to
increase productivity, reduce risks, and support smarter farming decisions.

# Project Objectives
- ### Simplify the buying and selling process :
Provide an easy-to-use platform for farmers to trade crops, seeds, and agricultural equipment.

- ### AI-based land diagnosis :
Enable the application to analyze soil and land conditions, detect issues at an early stage, and suggest practical solutions.

- ### Support farmer's decision-making :
Offer recommendations and guidance, and connect farmers with agricultural engineers when needed.

- ### Regular price updates :
Display continuously updated prices for crops, seeds, and equipment to help farmers make informed buying and selling decisions.

- ### Increase productivity and sustainability :
Help farmers improve crop yield and land health through data-driven insights and smart recommendations.

- ### Provide accessible agricultural knowledge :
Make agricultural information and tools available to farmers regardless of their location.

# Project Scope
- ### Application Features :
Farmer and seller profile management Marketplace for buying and selling crops, seeds, and agricultural equipment.
AI-based land health diagnosis based on land and soil specifications. 
Personalized recommendations to improve land quality.
Display of continuously updated market prices for crops, seeds, and equipment.

- ### Technical Scope :
Integration of an AI model to analyze soil and land data.
Database to store user profiles, products, diagnosis results, and price history.
Secure payment system.
Integration with reliable price data sources to ensure accurate market updates.

- ### Limitations :
AI-based diagnosis depends on the accuracy of user-provided data and may require human verification for critical cases.
Price updates depend on the reliability of external data sources.
The application is initially designed for local/regional use; scaling to wider markets will require additional technical planning.
